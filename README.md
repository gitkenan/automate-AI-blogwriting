## Customization Guide

### Search Terms and Topic Selection

The system uses carefully chosen search terms and ranking keywords to find relevant AI news. Here's how to customize them for your needs:

#### Search Queries
In `get_trending_ai_topics()`, modify the search queries based on your focus:
```python
search_queries = [
    'new AI tool release',
    'artificial intelligence development',
    'AI research breakthrough',
    'machine learning innovation',
    'AI technology advancement'
]
```
- These queries are designed to find news about new tools and developments rather than financial news
- Add queries relevant to your industry or specific AI interests
- Keep queries specific enough to get relevant results but broad enough to get sufficient content

#### Keyword Ranking System
In `rank_and_filter_topics()`, customize the keywords that determine article relevance:

```python
relevant_keywords = [
    'tool', 'launch', 'release',      # New product announcements
    'research', 'breakthrough',        # Technical developments
    'innovation', 'platform',          # Industry advancement
    'open source', 'model',           # AI model releases
    'small business'                  # Target audience focus
]

exclude_keywords = [
    'stock', 'market', 'invest',      # Financial news
    'price', 'revenue', 'earnings'    # Market performance
]
```

- Each relevant keyword match adds +1 to the topic's score
- Each exclude keyword match subtracts -0.5 from the score
- Adjust these weights in the code to make the filtering more or less strict

### Content Generation Prompt

The blog generation prompt in `generate_blog_post()` is crucial for producing content that matches your goals:

```python
prompt = (
    "Write an engaging and informative blog post that:"
    "1. Starts with a compelling title\n"
    "2. Relates to practical business benefits\n"
    "3. Breaks down complex AI concepts\n"
    "4. Includes real-world examples\n"
    "5. Highlights cost-effective solutions\n"
)
```

#### Customization Areas:

1. **Audience Focus**: Currently targets small business owners - modify for your target audience
2. **Content Structure**: Adjust the HTML formatting for your WordPress theme
3. **Tone and Style**: Change the professional yet approachable tone as needed
4. **Call to Action**: Customize the ending to match your business goals
5. **Ethical Guidelines**: Currently includes Sharia compliance - modify or remove based on your values

### Example Customizations

For a technical AI blog:
```python
relevant_keywords = ['algorithm', 'architecture', 'framework', 'implementation']
prompt = "Write a technical deep-dive into the AI technology..."
```

For an AI education blog:
```python
relevant_keywords = ['learning', 'tutorial', 'guide', 'introduction']
prompt = "Write a beginner-friendly explanation of the AI concept..."
```

Remember to test your customizations with a few sample runs to ensure the content meets your expectations.
